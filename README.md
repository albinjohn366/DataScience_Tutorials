## Gradient Descent Algorithm
Gradient descent (GD) is an iterative first-order optimisation algorithm used to find a local minimum/maximum of a given function. This method is commonly used in machine learning (ML) and deep learning(DL) to minimise a cost/loss function (e.g. in a linear regression).

### Feature Scaling
This is a technique used to reduce the range of data points such that it is easier to find the local minima than compared to a skewed range of datapoints.
