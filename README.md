Informations collected from various tutorials available online. This include python, visulaization tools, databases and machine learning.

To understand various mamchine learning techniques that are available. This involves using scikit library and understanding various models that can be used for different scenarios. The goal is to have a basic understanding on machine learning. This would further help in understanding which model to use by just looking at the dataset.

The informations are based on online research which includes scikit learn's own documentaion and tutorial.
